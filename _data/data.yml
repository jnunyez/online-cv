    title: Career Profile
    text: 'I currently work as a Senior Technology Expert/Researcher in Telefonica Core Innovation. My work is based on bridging the gap between telco and cloud by pursuing the automatization of telco functions and processes to cloud environments. Prior to this, I was a senior researcher in the Mobile Networks department of Centro Tecnológico de Telecomunicaciones de Cataluña (CTTC). I received the BsC in 2005 and the MsC in 2007 from the Computer Architecture Department from the Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña (UPC). In 2008, I received the national scholarship from the Torres Quevedo subprogram (PTQ-08- 01-06440). In 2014 he received the PhD from the Computer Architecture Department of the UPC.
In CTTC my work was based on devising PoC for 3G/4G/5G mobile networks: I have a vast experience in building proof-of-concepts that can validate the efficiency of theoretical concepts developed in a more fundamental research environment. During this period I also worked in pre-production environments with vendors such as Cisco, and Aviat Networks applying researched solutions on bonding and backhauling. Prior to joining CTTC, I worked for three years as a research networking engineer in the Advanced Broadband Communications Center within UPC. I worked as network and IT administrator of the research group. During this period, I combined the network + IT admin tasks with kernel development extending and testing Mobile IPv6 kernel code. I have co- authored more than 50 international conference and journal publications.'

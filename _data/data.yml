    title: Career Profile
    text: 'I currently work as a Senior Technology Expert/Researcher in Telefonica Core Innovation. Prior to this, I was a senior researcher in the Mobile Networks department of Centro Tecnológico de Telecomunicaciones de Cataluña (CTTC). I received the BsC in 2005 and the MsC in 2007 from the Computer Architecture Department from the Universidad Politécnica de Cataluña (UPC). In 2008, I received the national scholarship from the Torres Quevedo subprogram (PTQ-08- 01-06440). In 2014 he received the PhD from the Computer Architecture Department of the UPC.
In CTTC my work was based on devising PoC for 3G/4G/5G mobile networks: I have a vast experience in building proof-of-concepts that can validate the efficiency of theoretical concepts developed in a more fundamental research environment. During this period I also worked in pre-production environments with vendors such as Cisco, and Aviat Networks applying researched solutions on bonding and backhauling. 
Prior to joining CTTC, I worked for three years as a research networking engineer in the Advanced Broadband Communications Center within UPC. I worked as network and IT administrator of the research group. During this period, I combined the network + IT admin tasks with kernel development extending and testing Mobile IPv6 kernel code. I have co- authored more than 50 international conference and journal publications.'
